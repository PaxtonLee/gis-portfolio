Since we will have unanimous decision making policy we are going to be taking a shared approach to leadership where everyone is able to have equal say in what happens.

We will communicate by a text group chat or through Microsoft teams.

-- Team Procedure

The way we will handle going into meetings is before hand taking the time to acknowledge what needs to be looked at or worked on. Then going into the meeting and working on those specific things we decided on.

We are going to be using GitHub and Clockify to keep records.

If someone is absent we will still proceed with meetings and update the other person when there is time.

-- Team Participation

Communication and honesty are going to be the best strategies to ensure we work well together and allow for everyone to have an equal workload.

Being able to compromise and give something someone else says a try!

Using Trello to help keep us on task and what we should be doing on a day we plan to do work.

-- Personal Accountability

We will all be at every meeting unless there is extenuating circumstances where someone isn't able to be there and everyone is expected to meet their deadlines unless they communicate otherwise. Everyone should communicate with everyone equally and be committed to their work.

--Breach of Contract

I think it is understood between all of this if someone messes up it reflects on their grade so that is an infraction in its self and we will be using peer evaluation.



The paragraphs below detail our personal responsibilities for this project and are our signatures for the project.

Connor
I will be taking the lead on our client communication and team organization so I will be organizing our meetings, writing user stories, and putting together what everyone should be doing. The rest of my time I will just hop into whatever needs worked on help wherever I can. I will contribute to a positive group environment by being willing to make compromises with my teammates and to help them anytime they need it because I know they will do the same. If a conflict arises I think I will be able to step forward and talk about and bring about a way to resolve it that can hopefully please both parties.
