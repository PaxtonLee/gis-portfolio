Since we will have unanimous decision making policy we are going to be taking a shared approach to leadership where everyone is able to have equal say in what happens.

We will communicate by a text group chat or through Microsoft teams.

-- Team Procedure

The way we will handle going into meetings is before hand taking the time to acknowledge what needs to be looked at or worked on. Then going into the meeting and working on those specific things we decided on.

We are going to be using GitHub and Clockify to keep records.

If someone is absent we will still proceed with meetings and update the other person when there is time.

-- Team Participation

Communication and honesty are going to be the best strategies to ensure we work well together and allow for everyone to have an equal workload.

Being able to compromise and give something someone else says a try!

Using Trello to help keep us on task and what we should be doing on a day we plan to do work.

-- Personal Accountability

We will all be at every meeting unless there is extenuating circumstances where someone isn't able to be there and everyone is expected to meet their deadlines unless they communicate otherwise. Everyone should communicate with everyone equally and be committed to their work.

--Breach of Contract

I think it is understood between all of this if someone messes up it reflects on their grade so that is an infraction in its self and we will be using peer evaluation.



The paragraphs below detail our personal responsibilities for this project and are our signatures for the project.

#Connor
I will be taking the lead on our client communication and team organization so I will be organizing our meetings, writing user stories, and putting together what everyone should be doing. The rest of my time I will just hop into whatever needs worked on help wherever I can. I will contribute to a positive group environment by being willing to make compromises with my teammates and to help them anytime they need it because I know they will do the same. If a conflict arises I think I will be able to step forward and talk about and bring about a way to resolve it that can hopefully please both parties.

#Caleb
I will be focusing my efforts around the majority of the backend work. This does not set me exclusive to this category, but it will be my area of focus throughout the semester. I also plan to assist any group members in their own efforts if it is needed. I commit to help foster and produce a positive working environment among the team. I also commit to ensuring a high level of quality for the product we are going to deliver to the client.

#Paxton
My top focus will be helping the frontend and backend code work cohesively. Due to this sort of in-between role, I will be mainly working with Caleb and Ethan - splitting my workload as necessary between frontend (HTML, CSS, etc.) and backend (JavaScript, Ruby). In addition to this, I will be available to assist any group member with any other aspect of the project that they need help with. By writing this section of the file, I commit to each of the duties listed above, and to doing whatever I can to ensure that the group works together seamlessly and can produce the product that Dr. Hill wants.

#Ethan
My main priority will be the front end code (HTML, CSS, MD etc.), though I will not be confined strictly to this assignment as I am able to help wherever assistance is needed. I will be working with mainly Connor, to understand the work to be done, and Paxton while actually writing the code. I will out forth my best effort to contribute to a positive work environment and make myself as available as possible to assist my teammates in any way they may need. By writing this section I commit to each of the items listed above, and to doing whatever I can to ensure that the group  works together seamlessly so that we can produce the product that Dr. Hill commissioned.
